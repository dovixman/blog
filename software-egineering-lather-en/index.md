# Climbing the Engineering Ladder: From Junior Developer to Technical Lead

For the Spanish version go [here](/software-engineering-lather)

The journey from a junior developer to a Technical Lead is an incredible feat that requires continuous learning, adaptation, and growth. This article aims to provide insights into the necessary technical and soft skills needed at each step of this career ladder, along with recommended reads for each level.

The following list of recommended books does not contain any language-specific suggestions, as its objective is to be relevant to developers working with any programming language. The selection aims to cover a broad range of topics to facilitate the growth and development of software engineering professionals at every stage of their careers.

> Please note that the following list of recommended books and the software engineering ladder are based on my personal opinion. While these suggestions aim to be a helpful guide, they may not work for everyone or cover every possible career path in the software engineering field. I encourage you to use this information as a starting point to create your own ladder, tailored to your unique goals, preferences, and learning style.
